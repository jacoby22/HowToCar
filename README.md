# HowToCar
Codefellows_301_Final_Project

Description:

HowToCar.com is a website for anyone who has a car and would like to discover and track their car(s) required maintenance schedule(s). Find your vehicle using populated dropdown lists by vehicle make, model, and year. Customize your maintenance schedule to accommodate your car's needs. 

User Stories (MVP):

- As a user, I want to be able to login to my account on HowToCar so that I don't have to search for my car each time I visit the page.
- As a user, I want my profile login to be secure so that my data is protected from outside sources.
- As a user, I'd like the ability to find information about my car by using its make, model, and year so that I can learn more about my car's maintenance requirements.
- As a user, I want to be able to view my stored/saved car searches on a separate page, so that I can come back to my profile and view my car information.
- As a user, I want my site to be mobile friendly, so that I can view it easily while on the go.

Developer Stories (MVP):

- As a developer, I want a single page web application, so that I limit user load time and HTTP requests.
- As a developer, I want to reduce repetitive code by implementing Handlebars.js, so that I can reduce time spent coding and make code more adaptable.
- As a developer, I want to implement good SMACCS organization of my css files, so that it's easy to navigate through styling.
- As a developer, I want the webiste deployed live on the internet through a secure source (Heroku), so that my user's can have a safe and protected experience.
- As a developer, I want to implement the Edmunds.com API for gathering vehicle data, so I can utilize the maintenance lists for displaying on user search.
- As a developer, I want to use a SQL database, so that I can store user data as it is created.
- As a developer, I want to implement good MVC practice, so that my code is well-organized and per industry standard.
- As a developer, I want to use waffle.io to easily track tasks completed, so that my group doesn't write duplicative code and work done is easily documented.

User Stories (Stretch Goals):

- As a user, I want the ability to customize a maintenance schedule for myself, so that I can track only the mainenance issues I want to.
- As a user, I want to be able to look at a calender for upcoming maintenance items from my customized maintenance schedule, so that I can plan accordingly.
- As a user, I want to have a resources tab giving me the ability to look up more information on my car, so that I can continue to learn about my car as a whole.
- As a user, I want to have upcoming maintenance requests sent to me over email, so that I can be reminded without visiting the site when my upcoming services are required.

Developer Stories (Stretch Goals):

- As a developer, I want to implement the Google Calender API, so that I can make the maintenance requests more visually appealing and help remind the user when upcoming service requests are required.
- As a developer, I want to implement the Google Maps API, so that I can show nearby automotive resources to the user.
